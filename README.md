##Blocitoff

  Blocitoff is a ruby on rails app where users can create a free account, login, and create to-do tasks. Uses devise gem for account registration/verification. Users have a public profile where their tasks are displayed to other users.

  * uses faker gem to seed data
  * uses Ajax to add and delete items off the to-do list without refreshing the page
  * displays the time from when the item was created to when it will be deleted (7-day timer).
  * creates custom rake tasks to delete all to-do items over seven days old
